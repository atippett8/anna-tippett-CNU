Maynooth University in Ireland created a digital humanities (DH) project called Letters 1916-1923. 
Susan Schreibman and Monika Barget led this project which focuses on digitally collecting letters from 
institutions in Ireland about many people’s lives and the events during that time period including: the 
Easter Rising, The Great War, and The Anglo-Irish and Civil War. In this collection, each letter provides 
context about the sender and recipient of the letters and of the historical significance. There are hyperlinks 
to scans of the original letters and transcripts of the handwriting for ease of legibility. Schriebman’s 
team used a variety of digital tools to create this project: WordPress, Omeka, Scripto, Ruby on Rails, Python 
tools, LetEd, Discovery tool, and Admin tool. They also collected letters and photographs from many
[Irish institutions](http://letters1916.maynoothuniversity.ie/wp-post/about%2Finstitutions).

This DH website is an ongoing educational project, therefore the header bar at the top of the site is 
easy to navigate because it separates the research database and the contribution and submission sections 
components of the project. Under the “Explore the Collection” tab, it categorizes artifacts by specific 
historical events, source of origin, letter-writer, and the broad cultural topics they discuss. There is a 
list of keywords that break down the 4000+ letters and photographs into manageable amounts of navigable material.

While the layout for the artifact database page is logical, I noticed a single difficulty regarding the clarity
of the transcriptions because the computer software occasionally struggles to interpret the letters’ handwriting 
and typewriter words. In the image below, the spacing at the end of the first paragraph on the word “appearance” 
is warped. Looking at the original letter, it appears that this word has a typo in it and the transcription captures 
the error. There are even more transcription errors in handwritten letters than in this typed one. In the second image 
below the typed letter, a handwritten letter confused the computer software by creating more blanks in the transcription 
indicated by “{? ?}?”. A potential fix for this could be manually checking for visible and distracting errors in the 
transcriptions, though I know that would be time-consuming and expensive to maintain in a project such as this which is 
still collecting more letters. Nevertheless, I think the active decision to include a transcription at all, is a wonderful 
way to make the website accessible to readers with literacy disabilities and for people who may find the handwriting on 
the scanned letters difficult to read.

The other notable DH component to this project are the two interactive maps under the “Visual Exploration” tab, 
the first of which uses lines to connect cities where the most correspondence occurred and the second map showing 
the network of relationships between letter-writers. The interactive maps are visually easy to follow. The numbers 
show the amount of the letter writers and recipients in that major geographical area without the need for a map key 
to explain. When users zoom in on the map, there are red dots to show individual letter writers and recipients. 
Though the simplicity of the map is great, the red dots only give the name of the letter writer or recipient. 
They don’t provide hyperlinks to access those letters. This disconnect could be due to the multiple digital technologies 
that the project team used not being completely compatible with each other, or that this function of connecting the 
map to the letters is not possible. As it is, users would have to make note of the name of a letter writer/recipient, 
then use the separate webpage to find specific correspondence between those individuals. I think if there was a way 
to tie these two functions of the website together, it would be even more user friendly and convenient.

Overall, I think the site is navigable and accessible for people who are unfamiliar with digital humanity projects. 
It catalogues the artifacts in a logical and well-organized way. Though I pointed out where it can improve, it is one 
of the most logical and user-friendly DH projects I’ve seen in terms of ease of navigation and not requiring a user’s 
guide to explain how to find information. I truly think it has a broad appeal and polished layout to both satiate users’ 
personal curiosity or provide useful information for researchers searching for primary sources during the historical 
events that the artifacts reference.
