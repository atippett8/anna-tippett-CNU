I am a senior at Christopher Newport University in Newport News, Virginia. I’m majoring in English and double minoring in leadership studies and history. My preferred pronouns are she/her. In the future, I hope to pursue a career in publishing novels, particularly as an editor. I signed up for this class because I think it can help me become more prepared for a career that requires a fair amount of writing and some technological skills.

After this semester, I’m hoping to take some publishing/editing classes as a type of graduate school to help me prepare for a career in the field. In the past, my internship bosses have suggested applying for Columbia University’s program or to Temple University for editing and business writing. I decided to pursue publishing because when I was younger, I read books that changed my life and transported me to new and exciting worlds: 
* _The Harry Potter series_
*  _The Infernal Devices_
* _A Wrinkle in Time_
* _The Perks of Being a Wallflower_
* _The Percy Jackson and the Olympians series_
* etc.

I hope to pay that favor of brightening someone’s day with the promise of fictional worlds forwards one day. So far, I’ve worked several internships, one with an indie children’s publisher, one with a NYC literary agent, undergraduate research with a professor, and currently with a micro publisher of short stories.

Outside of my academic and career interests, I love to paint. From oil paint, watercolor, even acrylic, my favorite pictures have always been portraits because it’s always a challenge for me to accurately render people’s faces. I’ve also become a fan of baking desserts, particularly scones, cookies, macarons, and decorating cakes. At school, I used to be in the baking club, I’m currently in the English honors society, Sigma Tau Delta, in the PLP and Honors programs at CNU, and in the gymnastics club. 

Back at home, my family has five indoor cats, two tabbies, one tuxedo, one black and white, and one calico. My cat is Cinder, the long-haired one of the tabby cats. He’s hyperactive and known to eat just about anything, including peanut butter, green beans, cake, and corn. All of the cats are kind of rambunctious, have distinctive personalities. They have their poorly-timed moments of cuddliness to distract me from writing or I’m doing homework, but I don’t mind too much.
