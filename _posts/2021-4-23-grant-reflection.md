**Grant Writing Project:** 
Jeremiah and I decided to create a Digital Humanities project exploring the amount of diversity in young adult protagonists of books on the New York Times bestsellers list. As someone pursuing a career in the publishing industry, I found this topic particularly interesting. Jeremiah and I agreed that with our shared experiences as minorities in the United States, this project would help bring awareness to the lack of diversity in bestsellers and encourage positive change in the publishing industry. 
 
When we imagined our project, we laid out a detailed plan of how we would use DH elements to make the website more interactive, more visually appealing, and more accessible. In the process of figuring out the logistics of proposing such a project, I learned that many of the more complex technical elements of our plan would need adjusting to fit within our limited budget and capabilities as newcomers to the DH digital landscape.

Our goal of creating an interactive word cloud for the home page was a little too optimistic based on our technological skill sets. The interactive component would require special software that would not be free, therefore it would also not serve our budget. The best way to troubleshoot this portion of our plan for the project was to plan on hyperlinking the image of the word cloud to bring viewers to the main graphs page. Since the word cloud would feature on the homepage of our website, text below it would provide and introduction to the project, we thought this would work and not confuse viewers.

Another difficulty we ran into was that neither of us has experience in the more technical skills that we would need to accomplish some of the graph and hyperlink connections between web pages that we had initially hoped to create. After considering our skill sets, we modified a few of the DH elements of our project to serve our budget and capabilities. For example, we intended to create several bar graphs with clickable bars that would have hyperlinks to other tabs on our website. Using Tableau, the software we chose to create the graphs, we would have to pay a monthly fee to keep the graphs up and functional on the website. This was not possible within our budget. 
 
We resolved to only utilize Tableau for one month of each of the four years we intend to keep the site up to date (2020-2024). By sacrificing hyperlinking the bars on the graph, we could add the links as text just below the graphs with corresponding labels that indicated their connection to the bar graph. The website would still possess similar functions to the ones we had in mind, but we cut the cost of the software by 11/12ths.
 
There are a few similar projects to ours, but none exactly like it. Many projects focus on just one type of diversity in literature or on raising reader awareness about which published works portray the perspective of a minority character. Ours is a culmination of the research of several other projects in the same vein of diversity in literature, while possessing a few distinctly different parameters to narrow down our research to young adult bestsellers, protagonists, and comparing them to US census statistics about the diversity of our population.
 
**Digital Humanities class reflection:**
Before taking this class, I did not know what the Digital Humanities were. I had come across them in academic research, but I did not realize they were a separate and also interdisciplinary academic field. In this class, I learned several basic coding skills, how to write to a broader audience, and I believe I have developed a stronger grasp of both what DH is and why the field is necessary in an increasingly more digital society. 
 
As someone part of Generation Z who feels defined by my generationâ€™s tech-savvy and quick-paced social and academic culture, I think this course provides a great introduction to some of the more digital components of academic publication, creating a respectable professional image, and grant writing to open doors in financial stability for semi-artistic careers. I also think the grant-writing project is useful even for individuals who do not have plans of becoming digital humanists or working in technological fields. Writing skills are important in most all career fields and grant writing is useful for more creative fields. Also, addressing the digital aspects of the course, technology is not going away, therefore people must adapt and learn how to use it to our advantage.
