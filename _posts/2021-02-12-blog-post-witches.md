The University of Edinburgh created _Witches_, a digital humanities project about witchcraft trials in Scotland from 1550-1750. 
The project, led by project director Ewan McAndrew and main researcher Emma Carroll, tracks the 3141 documented people accused 
of and executed for witchcraft.
The maps show specific individual witch cases and the concentration of witchcraft events in areas of Scotland. 
McAndrew’s team utilized Ordnance Survey maps, books, and historical records on this project. 
They also used digital programs such as OpenRefine, Leaflet, ArcGIS, Wikimedia/WIKIDATA, and Query Service. 

The main menu at the top of the screen has light gray text. 
On mobile devices it has a button with three gray lines at the top of the screen, which can make accessibility difficult. 
It might be more navigable if there were darker text and boxes around the text to indicate that users can click on them. 
The menu lists various maps, which have icons with data about people associated with witchcraft. 
Some of the maps have specific features including using darker shading to show greater concentrations of witchcraft, 
and the use of two different witch icons—one with a single witch and one depicting a group of witches—helps simplify 
the appearance of the maps.

Not all accused men and women ended up receiving trials or were executed. 
The changes in the amount of people on the different maps show the discrepancies in severity of persecution. 
On most of the maps, the icons of individuals or clusters of witches has a pop up that links to the Survey of Scottish Witchcraft Database. 
This gives information on that specific individual’s place of origin and sometimes the location of their trial and execution. 
The information is brief, many entries lack data, but they are concise and easy to read.

The most complex pages on the site are The Journey of a Witch Pricker and The Story of Isobel Young. 
Witch-pricker John Kincaid’s page has a map with icons showing the people he accused of witchcraft and where he was also accused.
Isobel Young’s web page links to a story map made using Leaflet. 
Users can scroll through scans of primary documents and text while a map on the right of the screen highlights where the event the text refers to, took place.

There are also two pages with a different digital humanities technology: the Trial Ordeal and Social Class. 
Both pages use bubble maps, a cluster of circles with text in them, of various sizes to visually indicate their prominence. 
The first map shows how common certain torture was during witch trials, the second, the amount of people in each economic class.

If the project had a brief user guide on the home page, it could be more user-friendly. 
The rest of the site is navigable and accessible for users unfamiliar with digital humanities technologies. 
It works well in conveying individual and geographical data about the historical time period. 
The purpose of Witches is to combine many Scottish historical sources to create a single location to find information linked to Scottish witchcraft. 
The project manages to accomplish this goal quite well.
